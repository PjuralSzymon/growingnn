# Version History and GitHub Repository

## Releases Overview

This project has undergone multiple releases, each marking a significant advancement in its development. Below is a summary of the key versions:

### **Release 1 (R1) - 2023**
- The initial version of the project was built directly from the `master` branch.
- This version was developed as part of a thesis project and was not hosted in a GitHub repository.
- Provided the foundation for dynamic neural network adaptation and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based optimization.

### **Release 2 (R2) - 2024**
- This version was derived from the codebase used for the **ICCS 2024** paper:
  - **"Dynamic Growing and Shrinking of Neural Networks with Monte Carlo Tree Search"**
  - Published in *Computational Science – ICCS 2024* ([Springer LNCS, vol. 14832](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-63749-0_25))
  - Authors: **Szymon Świderski & Agnieszka Jastrzębska**
  - First Online: **June 28, 2024**
  - Pages: **362–377**
- Hosted on GitHub for improved version control and collaboration.
- Code improvements for performance and stability, incorporating refinements based on ICCS 2024 research findings.

### **Release 3 (R3) - 2025 (Ongoing)**
- Targeted for **ICCS 2025** submission, building upon the advancements made in R2.
- Further optimizations and enhancements to the Monte Carlo Tree Search approach.
